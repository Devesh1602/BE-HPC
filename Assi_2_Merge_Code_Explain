merge Function:
This function merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.
It takes three parameters: the array arr, and the indices l, m, and r, where l is the starting index of the first subarray, m is the ending index of the first subarray, and r is the ending index of the second subarray.
The function creates two temporary arrays L and R to store the elements of the two subarrays.
It then merges the elements of L and R back into the original array arr.

merge_sort Function:
This function implements the merge sort algorithm recursively.
It takes three parameters: the array arr, and the indices l and r, where l is the starting index of the subarray to be sorted and r is the ending index.
If the size of the subarray is greater than 1, the function calculates the middle index m and recursively calls merge_sort on the left and right halves of the array.
After sorting the two halves, it calls the merge function to merge them into a single sorted array.

parallel_merge_sort Function:
This function is a wrapper for the parallel version of merge sort.
It creates a parallel region using #pragma omp parallel and calls the merge_sort function with a single task (#pragma omp single) to initiate the parallel merge sort.

Main Function:
In the main function, a test array arr is defined with some initial values.
The execution time of the sequential merge sort algorithm is measured using the omp_get_wtime() function before and after calling merge_sort.
Similarly, the execution time of the parallel merge sort algorithm is measured using the parallel_merge_sort function.
Finally, the total execution times for both sequential and parallel merge sort are printed to the standard output.

Parallelization:
OpenMP directives (#pragma omp task and #pragma omp single) are used to parallelize the merge sort algorithm.
The parallel version divides the sorting task into smaller subtasks, which are executed concurrently by multiple threads.
This parallelization helps improve the performance of the merge sort algorithm by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
